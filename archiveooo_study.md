I am conducting a research study to collect attack data from archive.ooo that is funded by the Department of Defense.

Your participation in this study is voluntary, and you must be 18 or older to participate in the study.
If you choose not to participate there will be no penalty.

You have the right to stop participation at any time by stopping to interact with the vulnerable system.
